# MIMO_Model

This is an implimentation of a research paper, which is able to construct multilevel input and output deep learning model, it is made to deblur the images captured by a mobile. We can train model using above code commands:

First we need to create text files which will consists of input and output paths with respect to two text files.

Python Create_Path_files.py 

Python training.py

please change the paths as per requirement before running the above script.

This research project replicate the following research paper:

"Rethinking coarse-to-fine approach in single image deblurring"
